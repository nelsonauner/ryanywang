Hi, I'm Ryan. I spend a lot of time with data. The rest of the time I like to read books, learn new things, and track myself.

I live in Chicago and work as a consultant at [The Greatest Good](http://www.greatestgood.com). We solve business problems by applying simple, powerful ideas from economics and psychology.

I studied at the University of Chicago and love [Hyde Park, IL](http://visit.uchicago.edu/sites/visit.uchicago.edu/files/styles/galleryimage/public/uploads/images/chicago_uchicago.jpg?itok=bVgqHYGP). I also think fondly of my high school days at the Illinois Math & Science Academy, though Aurora, IL is much less picturesque.
