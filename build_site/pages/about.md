Hi, I'm Ryan. I work on data at [Stripe](https://stripe.com). The rest of the time I like to [read books](https://www.librarything.com/profile/rywang), [learn new things](https://www.coursera.org/user/i/192d0ab033f6b78b173b271575d6b7cc) and [play](http://www.usgo.org/ratings-lookup-id?PlayerID=10222) [games](http://ggtracker.com/players/70119/ryw).

Previously, I was a consultant at [The Greatest Good](http://www.greatestgood.com) and studied statistics and economics at the University of Chicago. I also think fondly of my high school days at the [Illinois Math & Science Academy](https://www.imsa.edu).
