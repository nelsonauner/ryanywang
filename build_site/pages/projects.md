**Ongoing**

* Ballr: An engine for analyzing NBA data.

* bbscraper: A set of functions for scraping basketball data. Code is still under construction. NBA data for '08-'09 through '12-'13 seasons is on [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/n5v0lejejxay9et/4xKZi_tFtU).

** Ideas **

I currently have more ideas than time to pursue them. Nonetheless I think some really are worth the effort, either by my future self or someone else. Let me know if you'd like to collaborate.

* A meta-analysis engine that extracts and aggregates results from publicly available scientific papers. Essentially an automated version of [Cochrane Reviews](http://www.cochrane.org/about-us).

* A quantified self dashboard for aggregating personal data e.g. from LibraryThing, Nike+, RescueTime.

* An open-source database that tracks the provenance and current location of artwork. The [Indianapolis Museum of Art](http://www.imamuseum.org/collections/artwork/flageolet-player-cliff-gauguin-paul) is a leader in making this type of information publicly available.
