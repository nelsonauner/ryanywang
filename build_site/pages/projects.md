**Ongoing**

* Ballr: An engine for analyzing NBA data.

* bbscraper: A set of functions for scraping basketball data. Code is still under construction. NBA data for '08-'09 through '12-'13 seasons is on [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/n5v0lejejxay9et/4xKZi_tFtU).

** Fun **

* [Data Mining](http://github.com/ryw90/data-mining-intersession) (with Scott Powers): Co-taught a 4 day workshop on data mining with R for high school students. *Jan 2014*

** School **

* [Seller Strategies and Price Dynamics on Amazon Marketplace](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ajsty32u8y390ov/seller%20strategies%20and%20price%20dynamics.pdf): My undergraduate economics thesis. It characterizes distinct groups of Amazon Marketplace sellers along multiple dimensions of pricing strategy. *2011-2012*

* [Sparse Coding and an Application to Topic Modeling](https://www.dropbox.com/s/d0jppn6nb1dcosm/sparse%20coding%20and%20topic%20models.pdf): My master's statistics thesis. It describes an implementation of sparse coding for topic modeling, as well as theoretical results for the procedure. *2011-2012*

* [Various Solutions to the Problem of Points](https://www.dropbox.com/s/e7p5j15xqseqaow/paper.pdf): My term paper for Stephen Stigler's course on the history of statistics. This classical problem is arguably the starting point in the development of probability theory. *Spring 2012*

* [Markov Chain Monte Carlo](https://www.dropbox.com/s/g9khwqjxdvhbvm4/Wang_REUPaper.pdf): A brief introduction to the theory and practice of Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, written as part of the UChicago Math REU program. *Summer 2010*

** Ideas **

I currently have more ideas than time to pursue them. Nonetheless I think some really are worth the effort, either by my future self or someone else. Let me know if you'd like to collaborate.

* A meta-analysis engine that extracts and aggregates results from publicly available scientific papers. Essentially an automated version of [Cochrane Reviews](http://www.cochrane.org/about-us).

* A database that tracks the provenance, current location, and exhibition record of artwork. The [Indianapolis Museum of Art](http://www.imamuseum.org/collections/artwork/flageolet-player-cliff-gauguin-paul) is a leader in making this type of information publicly available.
