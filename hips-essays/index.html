            <h2>Visualizing Essay Submission Times</h2>
<p>written on 2011-09-22, edited on 2014-02-04</p>
<p>I've long held the following hypotheses about my academic behavior: (1) that my ability to responsibly submit homework before deadlines decays exponentially as the quarter progresses and (2) that I end up completing homework at ungodly hours as a result.</p>
<p>In Spring 2011, I took a course on the History and Philosophy of Modern Science (HIPS) taught by <a href="http://home.uchicago.edu/~jevans/">Professor James Evans</a> that allowed for an interesting test for both myself and others. Every week, each student in the course was required to write a 700 word memo due by Thursday 9AM. These were posted on the course's <a href="https://chalk8.uchicago.edu/">Blackboard</a> forum and available to all those enrolled.</p>
<p>In the below, I experiment with a way to visualize submission times that captures the sequential nature (yes, I'm aware that the use of histograms would be sensible here). I plot submissions on a polar coordinate system in a way that mimicks a clock. Moreover, the points snake outwards based on the amount of time until the deadline. That is, essays submitted closer to the deadline are further from the center. Note that assignments 1 and 10 are omitted because they had unusual deadlines.</p>
<p>A few things jump out:</p>
<ul>
<li>Students really do write essays at ungodly hours (I'm assuming they don't just happen to submit them at 4AM for fun).</li>
<li>There is always a clump of students submitting their essays at the last minute, or after. Are these always the same students? Probably...</li>
<li>A fair number of people submitted Assignments 2 and 5 well before the deadline. Assignment 5 was due the same week as the midterm, so some students likely chose to get it out of the way ahead of time.</li>
<li>Given the above, it does seem like the ability to be responsible and finish homework ahead of time dissipates rather quickly.</li>
</ul>
<p>I must admit that I like how the graphs look (even if I don't think they're particularly useful). If anyone is interested in doing a more rigorous analysis, the code and data can be found <a href="https://github.com/ryw90/hips-essays">here</a>. Let me know if you learn anything interesting!</p>

<p>P.S. For reference, my submission times were all over the place: 2 - 4:08AM, 3 - 8:42AM, 4 - 8:41AM, 5 - 8:24PM, 6 - 12:22AM, 7 - 4:22AM, 8 - 12:57AM, 9 - 4:10AM. Needless to say that Spring 2011 wasn't the most restful quarter for me.</p>
